new images order:

the banner goes in the first blank space

then the name tags

THEN--between the video and the text that begins with "after iterating the letters", please add the photo of the sketchbook (theres no blank space mark here but i decided i wanted this here)

THEN, after the guide book flip thru, goes the risograph cards (the 5 bright colored flash card looking things)

then finally, goes "abcs book concept sketches". in the mockup i made this look like a big vertical space rather than horizontal but ignore that fact
